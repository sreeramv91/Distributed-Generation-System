# Distributed-Generation-System

Astractâ€”Providing a reliable, constant and stable electrical
supply is an important requirement for both industrial and
household electricity providers. As we move towards a more
sustainable approach of generating electricity (renewable and
nuclear) from the currently widespread non-renewable sources,
an intermediate step is a supply system that employs a hybrid
approach. To demonstrate the possibility of such a deployment,
this project aims to simulate a three-phase power plant that
combines a traditional steam turbine and a DC-AC inverter
generation system that is driven by solar or wind energy, to
deliver a total 100kW of power with a power factor of 1.
